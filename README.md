#  Sales Prediction
### I’m Mohammed Zeeshan  
This is my **Data Science Internship Project** with **CodSoft**, where I explored how data can help predict sales and guide smarter business decisions.

## About This Project  
This project predicts how much a product will sell based on how much is spent on **TV, Radio, and Newspaper advertising**.  

It may sound simple, but this kind of prediction is exactly what companies use to plan their marketing budgets.  
Using past data, my model learns how different types of advertising affect sales — and then predicts future results.

## Step-by-Step Overview  
1. **Data Collection** – I worked with a dataset of 200 records showing ad spending and product sales.  
2. **Data Exploration** – I checked patterns, correlations, and relationships between variables.  
3. **Feature Engineering** – Created extra columns like total ad spend, spending ratios, and interaction effects.  
4. **Model Training** – Used a **Linear Regression** model to teach the computer how ad budgets influence sales.  
5. **Model Testing** – Verified accuracy using test data and performance metrics.  
6. **Visualization** – Plotted graphs to show how close predictions were to actual results.  
7. **New Predictions** – Gave the model new ad budgets to predict expected sales.

## What I Learned  
- How to clean and analyze data with **pandas** and **NumPy**.  
- How **machine learning** models learn patterns from data.  
- How visualizations make insights easy to understand.  
- The importance of testing models with new data.  
- That even small datasets can reveal meaningful business insights.

## Tools and Libraries Used  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**  
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**  
- **Scikit-learn**

## Results in Simple Words  
The model learned that:
- **TV and Radio ads** have the biggest effect on sales.  
- **Newspaper ads** don’t influence much.  
- The final model reached around **90% accuracy (R² ≈ 0.9)**, which shows strong prediction ability.

## Dataset Source  
The dataset is stored publicly on GitHub for easy access.  
You don’t need to upload it manually — the notebook loads it automatically from this link:

## How to Run This Project  
1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab**:  
   👉 [Click Here to Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/z33shxn/Sales-Prediction-CodSoft-/blob/main/Sales_Prediction_Project.ipynb)  
2. Click **Runtime → Run all**.  
3. The notebook will automatically load the dataset and generate all results and graphs.

## Why This Project Is Unique  
Every line of code was written and tested by me.  
I didn’t copy templates — I built each step by understanding what it does and why it matters.  
My goal was to make this project simple enough for anyone to understand, yet detailed enough to look professional.

---

## A Small Reflection  
Before this project, I only saw data as numbers.  
Now, I see it as a way to **tell stories and make smarter choices**.  
This project taught me not just how to code — but how to think like a problem solver.
